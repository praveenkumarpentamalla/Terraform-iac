## **1. Terraform Project Recap**

### **What We Achieved:**
- Automated 3-tier infrastructure deployment using Terraform.
- Integrated Terraform with Jenkins for CI/CD.
- Deployed resources across multiple AWS regions.

### **Key Components:**
- **Web Servers**: Apache/Nginx with user data scripts.
- **Application Servers**: Tomcat/Java/Python/Node.js.
- **Database Servers**: MySQL/ArangoDB.
- **Load Balancer**: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
- **S3 Bucket**: For artifact storage.
- **IAM Users**: Managed with Terraform.

### **Commands Used:**
```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## **2. 3-Tier Architecture with Terraform**

### **Architecture Overview:**
1. **Web Tier**: 
   - 2+ web servers (Apache/Nginx).
   - ELB for traffic distribution.
2. **Application Tier**:
   - 2+ app servers (Tomcat/Java/Python/Node.js).
3. **Database Tier**:
   - MySQL/ArangoDB database.

### **Terraform Code Structure:**
```hcl
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-southeast-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  user_data     = file("user_data.sh")
}

resource "aws_elb" "web_elb" {
  instances = [aws_instance.web_server.id]
}
```

### **Benefits:**
- **Scalability**: Easy to add/remove resources.
- **Consistency**: Repeatable infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use.

## **3. CI/CD Integration with Jenkins**

### **Pipeline Steps:**
1. **Checkout**: Fetch code from GitHub.
2. **Init**: Initialize Terraform.
3. **Validate**: Check syntax errors.
4. **Plan**: Preview changes.
5. **Apply**: Deploy infrastructure.
6. **Destroy**: Clean up resources (optional).

### **Jenkins Pipeline Example:**
```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = credentials('aws-access-key')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('aws-secret-key')
  }
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/username/repo.git'
      }
    }
    stage('Terraform Init') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform init'
      }
    }
    stage('Terraform Apply') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Best Practices:**
- Store credentials in Jenkins securely.
- Use parameterized builds for flexibility.
- Monitor pipelines for failures.

## **4. Deployment Strategies**

### **Blue-Green Deployment:**
- **Description**: Maintain two identical environments (blue = old, green = new).
- **Process**:
  1. Deploy new version to green environment.
  2. Switch traffic from blue to green.
  3. Decommission blue environment.
- **Benefits**: Zero downtime, easy rollback.

### **Rolling Deployment:**
- **Description**: Gradually replace old instances with new ones.
- **Process**:
  1. Deploy new instances alongside old ones.
  2. Shift traffic to new instances.
  3. Remove old instances.
- **Benefits**: Minimal downtime, resource-efficient.

### **Canary Deployment:**
- **Description**: Release new version to a small subset of users.
- **Process**:
  1. Deploy new version to a few servers.
  2. Monitor performance and user feedback.
  3. Roll out to all users if successful.
- **Benefits**: Risk mitigation, real-time testing.

### **Recreating Deployment:**
- **Description**: Shut down old version and deploy new one.
- **Process**:
  1. Stop old application.
  2. Deploy new version.
  3. Start new application.
- **Benefits**: Simplicity, no resource duplication.

## **5. Resume Building Tips**

### **For Experienced Candidates:**
- **Profile Summary**: Highlight DevOps expertise, tools, and achievements.
- **Technical Skills**: List tools (Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).
- **Projects**: Describe real-world implementations with metrics.
- **Certifications**: Include relevant certifications (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes).

### **For Freshers:**
- **Education**: Place technical skills above academics.
- **Projects**: Detail personal/learning projects.
- **Strengths**: Focus on adaptability, teamwork, and communication.
- **Certifications**: Mention course completions (e.g., "DevOps Training from NareshIT").

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Donâ€™t put academics at the top of your resume.
- Avoid generic strengths like "cooking" or "traveling."
- Never expose sensitive information (e.g., AWS keys).

## **6. Interview Preparation**

### **Key Topics to Revise:**
1. **Terraform**: Lifecycle, workspaces, modules.
2. **Jenkins**: Pipelines, credentials, integration.
3. **Docker**: Containers, images, Dockerfile.
4. **Kubernetes**: Pods, deployments, services.
5. **AWS**: EC2, S3, VPC, IAM.
6. **Deployment Strategies**: Blue-green, rolling, canary.

### **Sample Questions:**
